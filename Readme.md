# Facial Attractiveness Prediction

This is the repository for the predicting facial attractiveness using landmark features and gabor filters.

Features obtained from:
* Facial Distances
* Facial Ratios
* Gabor Filters

How to run: 
* All features first must be generated by running generate_features.py
* Then you can train your own model by running train.py
* You can test with a single image by running demo.py (give the path at the beginning)

Required libraries: Dlib, OpenCV, numpy, scipy,sklearn
